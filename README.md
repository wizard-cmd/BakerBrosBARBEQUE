 THIS IS OUR NEW SITE, DISREGARD OLD BAKERBROS
home page named index.html
all lowercase

css file named style.css

only 1 css file (need to condense that a bit)

Java - all of it  needs to go main.js

Comments should be used to divide the diffrent parts/containers



ALL STYLES IN STYLES.CSS FILE
 
Naming should be consistent, java should always be lowerCamalSpace




Feedback:

ALL content should go between body tags. Also check files for repeats of closing body tags and insert scripts correctly. Noticed on the about page but check all of them.
If you are not going to use the footer info, take it out

Read all of your page content. I read the info on the About section and found 3 errors
